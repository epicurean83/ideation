"""Escalating fetcher for Phase 4, used only when WebFetch cannot reach a source.

WebFetch honours robots.txt AI-agent directives, so a growing share of otherwise
public pages come back as "unable to fetch" rather than as content. This script is
the sanctioned second attempt: it fetches with a real browser stack and reports
exactly which tier succeeded, so the provenance lands in the source frontmatter
instead of being silently laundered.

Tiers (tried in order, stops at the first that yields real content):
    http     Fetcher.get with Chrome TLS/header impersonation
    browser  DynamicFetcher — real headless Chromium, runs the page's JS

Deliberately NOT implemented — these are out of scope, not "not yet":
    * Cloudflare / CAPTCHA challenge solving (StealthyFetcher solve_cloudflare)
    * cookies, credentials, or auth headers of any kind
    * paywall or login-wall circumvention

An auth wall or an anti-bot challenge is a terminal result here. The caller falls
back to the existing protocol in channels.md (preprint -> archive -> author copy ->
alternative source) or to a documented endpoint in api_sources/ — a site that
blocks bots almost always has an API that does not.

Content is always extracted with main_content_only=True, which runs scrapling's
prompt-injection sanitiser (drops CSS-hidden and aria-hidden nodes, <template>,
HTML comments, zero-width characters). Fetched pages are untrusted input; a
sub-agent reads this output, so the sanitiser is mandatory, not cosmetic.

Exit codes: 0 ok · 3 robots-disallowed · 4 blocked (auth wall / anti-bot) · 5 error
